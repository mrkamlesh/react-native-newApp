# React Native News App

## Acquiring Free API Key

Next step is getting a free API key at [News API](https://newsapi.org/) witch will help us make some call requests to the server and retrieve the news articles. 

Once the api key is in your hands, go to `src/config/rest_consfig.js` and paste it to where it said put “PUT_YOUR_API_KEY_HERE”.

## Installing dependencies

After the downloading the repository head on to the project root folder and run the ` $ npm install` command line.


## Run application

` $ react-native start `
` $ react-native run-android/run-ios `
